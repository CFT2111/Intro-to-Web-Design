# Intro to Web Design
* Open a web browser (Chrome or FireFox)
* Find a website (or several) that you like the design of. Try to put into words why you like the design of the site. 
    * Discuss your chosen site with the person sat next to you

Next think about different ways of evaluating the design of the site. Here are three things to consider:

## Fit for mobile 
In order to test what a site will look like on a mobile device use the browser's developer tools. Developer tools are built into all popular web browser and allow us to inspect parts of a web page and test things like the performance of a web page what it might look like on a mobile device. 

* Here are a couple of links on using developer tools.
    * Google Chrome - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/
    * Mozilla Firefox - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Open_the_Inspector

* Use the developer tools to view some websites in responsive design mode.
* Using responsive design mode, again think about the design of the website you are looking at?
    * Does the design change for smaller screens
    * What happens to the navigation
    * Does the design still work?

## Page Speed
A really important factor in web design is page speed, how fast a web page loads. 
* Again, using the developer tools (the network tab) see how long your chosen website takes to load. 
* Developer tools can mimic different connection speeds. Try adjusting the connection speed and seeing the impact on page load times. 
* There are also online tools that will analyse page load times e.g. PageSpeed Insights - https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/. Try testing your website with PageSpeed Insights.
* If you are using Chrome, another tool you can use is Lighthouse:
    * In developer tools select *audit*  and then choose the performance audit to get a score for the site

## Accessibility
* Another important consideration is accessibility - will people with disabilities be able to access and use the site.
* Testing accessibility is difficult but there are tools that can help us. Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) is a browser extension that will report on common accessibility issues. 
    * Visit https://wave.webaim.org/extension/ and follow the link for either Chrome or Firefox to install the extension.
* Test some website using the WAVE tool. Don't worry if you don't understand all the errors, at the moment we just want to get an understanding of the kind of issues we will be paying attention to during the course of the module.
